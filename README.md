[Demo - first version, very simple](https://foodwarehouse-b9pth5klm.now.sh/)

My first bigger project in react.

You can add items to your list in nine category(pasta, meat, fruit and vegetables and more)
Specify the maximum and minimum quantity, control the quantity that is available.If the 
amount of product exceeds the minimum, the item will appear on the list, which you can 
send by e-mail, text or print.

In settings you can change language and theme.

You can log with mail.

I used Firebase as database and to authentication.
