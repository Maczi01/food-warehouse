You can add items to your list in nine category(pasta, meat, fruit and vegetables and more)
Specify the maximum and minimum quantity, control the quantity that is available.<br/>If the
amount of product exceeds the minimum, the item will appear on the list, which you can
send by e-mail, text or print.

In settings you can change language and theme.

You can log with mail.

I used Firebase as database and to authentication.<br/>
